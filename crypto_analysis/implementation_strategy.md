# Implementation Strategy for Cryptocurrency Price Prediction System

This document outlines a comprehensive implementation strategy for developing a cryptocurrency price prediction system as described in the Proof of Concept (POC). The strategy covers data pipeline architecture, model selection framework, implementation approach, and deployment considerations.

## 1. Data Pipeline Architecture

### 1.1 Data Collection Layer

**Primary Data Source: CoinGecko API**
- Implement scheduled data collection jobs using Python scripts and cron jobs
- Collect historical OHLCV (Open, High, Low, Close, Volume) data for selected cryptocurrencies
- Store raw data in structured format (CSV/Parquet files or database)
- Implement error handling and retry mechanisms for API failures
- Set up monitoring for API rate limits and usage

**Secondary Data Source: Binance API**
- Collect real-time market data for short-term predictions
- Implement WebSocket connections for live order book and trade data
- Store high-frequency data in time-series optimized storage

**Supplementary Data: CoinMarketCap API**
- Collect market-wide metrics and trending information
- Use for validation and cross-checking of primary data sources

### 1.2 Data Preprocessing Layer

**Data Cleaning**
- Remove outliers and handle missing values
- Normalize timestamps across different data sources
- Implement data quality checks and validation

**Feature Engineering**
- Create technical indicators:
  - Moving Averages (Simple, Exponential, Weighted)
  - Relative Strength Index (RSI)
  - Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD)
  - Bollinger Bands
  - Volume indicators
- Create time-based features:
  - Day of week
  - Hour of day
  - Month
  - Is weekend/holiday
- Create market sentiment features:
  - Volatility indices
  - Market trend indicators
  - Cross-currency correlations

**Data Transformation**
- Normalize/standardize numerical features
- Apply min-max scaling for neural network models
- Create lagged features for time-series analysis
- Split data into training, validation, and test sets (70%/15%/15%)

### 1.3 Data Storage Layer

**Raw Data Storage**
- Time-series database (InfluxDB or TimescaleDB) for high-frequency data
- PostgreSQL for structured market data
- S3-compatible object storage for historical data archives

**Processed Data Storage**
- Feature store for preprocessed features
- Versioned datasets for model training
- Cached predictions for performance optimization

## 2. Model Selection Framework

### 2.1 Primary Model: Bi-LSTM Neural Network

Based on research findings, Bi-LSTM (Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory) networks have shown superior performance for cryptocurrency price prediction with lower MAPE values compared to standard LSTM and GRU models.

**Architecture**
- Input layer with normalized features
- 2-3 Bi-LSTM layers with dropout
- Dense layers with appropriate activation functions
- Output layer for price prediction

**Hyperparameters**
- Sequence length: 30-60 days (adjustable based on prediction horizon)
- Learning rate: 0.001 with adaptive optimization (Adam)
- Batch size: 32-64
- Epochs: Early stopping based on validation loss

### 2.2 Secondary Models

**Facebook Prophet**
- For trend and seasonality decomposition
- Particularly effective for longer-term predictions
- Minimal data preprocessing requirements

**XGBoost**
- For classification tasks (price direction prediction)
- Feature importance analysis
- Robust to overfitting with proper regularization

**ARIMA/SARIMA**
- For short-term predictions (1-7 days)
- Baseline model for comparison
- Effective for stable market conditions

### 2.3 Ensemble Approach

Implement a weighted ensemble of models to leverage strengths of different approaches:
- Bi-LSTM for capturing complex patterns
- Prophet for trend and seasonality
- XGBoost for classification and feature importance
- ARIMA for short-term baseline predictions

Weights will be dynamically adjusted based on recent performance metrics.
